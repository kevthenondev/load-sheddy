Here are some rough instructions for Windoze setup

1. Install WAMP http://s1.softaculous.com/a/ampps/files/Ampps-3.8-setup.exe
2. Create MySQL db
3. Create a mysql user for yourself
4. git clone git@github.com:rabzobi/load-sheddy.git
5. ensure apache DocumentRoot points at the www directory you have checked out
6. create db.php (details from step 2 and 3)

<?php
	$servername = "127.0.0.1";
	$username = "user";
	$password = "password";
	$dbname = "load-sheddy";
	$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
	if ($conn->connect_error) {
		die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
	} 

7. If you want to run multiple sites you need to setup VirtualHost's apache config and add ServerName to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
